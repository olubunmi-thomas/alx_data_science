    # Understanding and Trusting Data
    Data doesn't lie, but it can hide. When a government audit threatens to freeze the Ministry of Agriculture's funding, the gap between an unverified spreadsheet and a defensible dataset is three weeks of rigorous proof. In this project, you step into an emergency data audit for Maji Ndogo: you profile distributions, break rainfall down by province, weigh each crop's yield, and trace the true drivers of productivity through a Seaborn correlation heatmap. It is exactly the kind of high-stakes, story-driven exploratory data analysis that proves you can trust data under pressure.

    - Do not add or remove cells in this notebook. Do not edit or remove the `### START FUNCTION` or `### END FUNCTION` comments. Do not add any code outside of the functions you are required to edit. Doing any of this will result in a mark of 0%.

    The letter from the government auditor arrives on a Tuesday.

    It is polite but unmistakable: the Ministry of Agriculture has three weeks to demonstrate that the Maji Ndogo farm survey data is accurate before it can be used to allocate funding. If the data cannot be independently verified, the entire project gets put on hold.

    Sanaa reads the letter twice, puts it face-down on the desk, and turns to you.

    "We have weather stations across the region," she says. "Five of them. They record temperature, rainfall, and pollution independently of our field teams — IoT sensors, real-time data. If our field measurements agree with the station readings, we have a defensible case." She pauses. "If they do not..."

    She does not finish the sentence.

    Your job starts now. The audit clock is running, and the first step is to understand the data as it stands — distribution by distribution, relationship by relationship, pattern by pattern. This notebook is your field report. Every chart you produce, every number you note down, is evidence you can take into that audit. Work carefully.

    ## Challenge 1: Dataset Summary Metrics

    Every analysis starts by understanding what you are working with. Before building complex charts, let's extract the essential dimensions: how many columns the joined survey has, and the average elevation across all fields.

    ### Task
    Write a function `get_dataset_summary` that accepts the dataset and returns a tuple `(number_of_columns, mean_elevation)`, where `number_of_columns` is an `int` and `mean_elevation` is the mean of the `Elevation` column.

    ## Wrap Up

    You have completed the exploratory analysis of the Maji Ndogo farm survey dataset.

    Six challenges have mapped out a growing picture of what the data actually contains — which provinces are dry (Amanzi, Kilimani) and which are wet (Sokoto), which crops dominate (wheat) and which are rare-but-productive (rice), and which variables move together (pollution and yield) versus on their own. Each result is a line in the field report you can take into the audit: independently checkable, reproducible from the database, and honest about how strong — or weak — each relationship really is.

    That last point is the heart of *trusting* data: an analyst who reports a weak correlation as weak is worth more than one who oversells it. Ensure all unit tests pass before final submission — then walk into that audit with evidence you can defend line by line.
