    A single-variable baseline isn’t enough; now it's time to see the whole picture. To help grid operators manage supply, the Ministry needs models that process national weather patterns simultaneously. In this project, you build your first Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model using scikit-learn to handle multi-city inputs. You will isolate redundant weather drivers using Variance Inflation Factors (VIF), implement an 80/20 train-test split, run Durbin-Watson diagnostics to check time-series independence, and plot residuals to test for homoscedasticity. It is the exact diagnostic checkpoint that scales the work from simple baselines to multi-variable models.

    The government of Spain has reviewed your Part A findings. They appreciate the honesty — simple linear regression using a single predictor explained only about 3% of the variance in the energy shortfall. But they need more than an honest baseline. They need a model that the grid operators can actually use.

    Your contact at the Ministry of Energy puts it plainly: "Temperature drops in Madrid on the same day it drops in Seville. Wind picks up along the coast while the interior stays still. These patterns are what drive the shortfall. We need your model to see all of it at once."

    This is exactly what **Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)** is built for. Instead of fitting one line through one predictor, MLR fits a hyperplane through many predictors simultaneously — letting the model separate the contribution of each city's weather while accounting for the others.

    But more predictors come with new responsibilities. When predictors are too similar to each other — a condition called **multicollinearity** — the model's coefficients become unreliable and interpretations break down. And because Spain's energy data is a time series recorded every three hours, we must check that residuals are not autocorrelated, which would violate the independence assumption of linear regression.

    By the end of this notebook you will have:

    - Fit your first MLR model using scikit-learn with five simultaneous predictors.
    - Diagnosed multicollinearity using the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF).
    - Applied the train-test split to evaluate out-of-sample performance.
    - Tested residual independence using the Durbin-Watson statistic.
    - Assessed homoscedasticity by plotting residuals against fitted values.

    > **AI assist:** This module introduces MLR diagnostics that can feel abstract. Good prompts: *"Explain the Variance Inflation Factor in plain language — what does a VIF of 9,000 actually mean for a regression model?"* *"What is the Durbin-Watson test checking, and why does it matter for time-series regression data?"*

    ## Data Setup

    ### Data Dictionary

    The dataset contains 3-hourly weather readings from five Spanish cities — Madrid, Seville, Valencia, Bilbao, and Barcelona — alongside the corresponding energy shortfall.

    **Target variable**
    - `load_shortfall_3h`: The shortfall between fossil fuel and renewable energy generation over 3 hours (Float). This is what we are predicting.

    **Weather features (per city)**
    - `{city}_temp`: Average temperature in Kelvin (Float).
    - `{city}_humidity`: Relative humidity as a percentage (Float).
    - `{city}_wind_speed`: Wind speed in m/s (Float).
    - `{city}_pressure`: Atmospheric pressure in hPa (Float, except `Seville_pressure` which is categorical string).
    - `{city}_clouds_all`: Cloud coverage as a percentage (Float).

    **Columns requiring preprocessing**
    - `Valencia_wind_deg`: Encoded as string levels (`level_1` through `level_10`) — extract the numeric value.
    - `Seville_pressure`: Encoded as strings (`sp1` through `sp25`) — extract the numeric value.
    - `Valencia_pressure`: Contains approximately 2,000 missing values — rows will be dropped.

    **Setup:** Run the cell below to load and prepare the data before attempting any challenge.

    ## Challenge 1: Fitting a Multiple Linear Regression Model

    Temperature is recorded across all five cities in our dataset. Rather than choosing just one city's temperature as we did in Part A, we can bring all five in simultaneously. This allows the model to learn the *combined* influence of temperature conditions across Spain — Madrid's continental climate, Seville's heat, the coastal moderation in Barcelona.

    ### Task
    Create a function named `fit_temperature_mlr` that:
    - Takes a DataFrame as input.
    - Uses the following five features as predictors: `Madrid_temp`, `Seville_temp`, `Valencia_temp`, `Bilbao_temp`, `Barcelona_temp`.
    - Fits a multiple linear regression model on the **full dataset**.
    - Returns a tuple `(model, r2, rmse)` containing the fitted model object, R-squared on the full dataset, and RMSE on the full dataset.

    **Note:**
    - Use `LinearRegression` from `sklearn.linear_model`.
    - Return format: `(model, r2, rmse)`.

    ## Challenge 2: Diagnosing Multicollinearity with VIF

    Before trusting any coefficient in an MLR model, we need to check for **multicollinearity** — the condition where two or more predictors are highly correlated with each other. When predictors move together, the model cannot isolate each one's individual contribution, and coefficients become statistically unstable.

    The **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)** measures this directly. For each predictor, VIF answers: "How much larger is the variance of this coefficient than it would be if this predictor were uncorrelated with all the others?"

    **Rules of thumb:**
    - VIF < 5: Low multicollinearity — acceptable.
    - VIF 5–10: Moderate — worth monitoring.
    - VIF > 10: High — the predictor is likely redundant.

    ### Task
    Create a function named `calculate_vif` that:
    - Takes a DataFrame and a list of feature column names as input.
    - Calculates the VIF for each feature.
    - Returns a DataFrame with columns `feature` and `VIF`, sorted by VIF in descending order with the index reset.

    ## Challenge 3: Train-Test Split and Performance Evaluation

    Fitting and evaluating on the same data, as we did in Challenge 1, can give an overly optimistic view of performance. A model that has seen every training example can fit those points closely, but then fail when it encounters new data it has never seen.

    The train-test split gives us an honest estimate: train on 80%, evaluate on the held-out 20%. If test performance is close to training performance, the model is generalizing. If test performance is dramatically worse, the model is overfitting.

    ### Task
    Create a function named `mlr_train_test_evaluate` that:
    - Takes a DataFrame as input.
    - Uses `Madrid_temp`, `Seville_temp`, `Valencia_temp`, `Bilbao_temp`, `Barcelona_temp` as predictors and `load_shortfall_3h` as the target.
    - Splits the data with `test_size=0.2` and `random_state=42`.
    - Trains on the training set, evaluates on the test set.
    - Returns `(r2, rmse), (predictions, y_test)`.

    ## Challenge 4: Checking Residual Independence — Durbin-Watson

    Our dataset is a **time series** — energy readings recorded every 3 hours over multiple years. This creates a specific risk: the error our model makes at 9 a.m. might predict the error it makes at noon. If residuals are correlated across time (**autocorrelation**), the independence assumption of linear regression is violated, and our standard errors — and therefore our p-values and confidence intervals — are unreliable.

    The **Durbin-Watson statistic** detects this. It ranges from 0 to 4:

    | Value | Interpretation |
    |---|---|
    | ~2 | No autocorrelation — independence assumption holds ✅ |
    | < 1.5 | Positive autocorrelation — model is missing a time trend |
    | > 2.5 | Negative autocorrelation — over-correction between consecutive residuals |

    ### Task
    Create a function named `check_residual_independence` that:
    - Takes `predictions` and `y_test` (from Challenge 3).
    - Calculates the residuals as `y_test - predictions`.

    ## Challenge 5: Assessing Homoscedasticity — Residuals vs. Fitted

    The final diagnostic we need is **homoscedasticity**: the assumption that the variance of residuals is roughly constant across all predicted values. A model that is highly accurate at low predicted values but wildly off at high predicted values violates this assumption — and tells us the model structure is missing something.

    The standard check is a scatter plot of residuals against fitted values (predictions). In a well-specified model, this plot should look like a horizontal band of roughly equal scatter around the zero line, with no obvious funnel, curve, or cluster.

    - Takes `predictions` and `y_test` (from Challenge 3).

    | Residuals vs. Fitted | Roughly uniform band | No obvious heteroscedasticity |

    More predictors do not automatically mean a better model. When predictors carry the same information, they compete with each other rather than complementing each other. The model's R-squared barely moved despite quadrupling the predictor count.

# This cell has NO declared dependencies — it runs even when other cells
# have not. It uses dynamic name lookup (eval + try/except) so the learner
# always gets actionable feedback, including a "run all cells first" hint
# when nothing has been defined yet.

# The spec below is auto-generated at conversion time from the test_suite
# (which functions pytest references) and the model solution (the canonical
# parameter names + body characteristics).
