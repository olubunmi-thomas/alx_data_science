    The diagnostic groundwork is complete; now it’s time to deploy. Having isolated the overlapping weather signals that bloated your baseline, the Maji Ndogo Department of Energy needs a regularized model ready for production. In this project, you build a complete end-to-end regression pipeline using scikit-learn. You will prune noisy variables using correlation thresholding, neutralize scaling bias via `StandardScaler`, and implement Ridge and LASSO regularization to penalize unstable coefficients. Finally, you will serialize your architecture using `pickle` to deliver a persistent, automated forecasting tool. It is the exact optimization workflow that transitions a machine learning project from an exploratory notebook into a deployed enterprise solution.

    Three modules ago you proved that linear relationships exist between Maji Ndogo's weather patterns and its energy shortfall. Two modules ago you demonstrated that naively adding more predictors — five provincial temperatures — barely improved the model, because multicollinearity was eating the signal. This module, you fix that.

    The Maji Ndogo Department of Energy has given a clear mandate: build a model they can deploy. That means one that is accurate enough to plan infrastructure investments, robust enough to run on data it has never seen, and persistent enough to run again next month without retraining.

    You are completing the full production pipeline:

    | Step | Technique | Purpose |
    |---|---|---|
    | Feature pruning | Correlation thresholding | Eliminate low-signal, high-noise predictors |
    | Preprocessing | StandardScaler | Put features on equal footing before penalization |
    | Regularization | Ridge (L2) | Shrink unstable multicollinear coefficients |
    | Regularization | LASSO (L1) | Zero out the least useful features entirely |
    | Persistence | pickle | Save the trained model for deployment |
    | Submission | predict on test set | Deliver predictions to the Department |

    The dataset comes from five Maji Ndogo provinces — Sokoto, Kilimani, Hawassa, Amanzi, and Akatsi — recording temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, and other weather variables every 3 hours. Your target is `energy_shortfall_3h`: the gap between fossil-fuel and renewable energy generation during each 3-hour window on the national grid.

    Your RMSE submission will appear on the leaderboard. Every unit of improvement represents a real reduction in the Department's forecasting error. Build it well.

    > **AI assist:** Use AI actively this module. Good prompts: *"Explain the difference between Ridge and LASSO regularization in terms of what happens to small coefficients."* *"What is data leakage, and why must I never refit a StandardScaler on test data?"*

    ### Evaluation Metric

    **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)** — lower is better. Every reduction in RMSE represents a real improvement in the Department's ability to plan energy infrastructure across Maji Ndogo's five provinces.

    ## Data Preparation

    Two columns require preprocessing before any modeling:
    - `Hawassa_wind_deg`: Wind direction encoded as string levels (`level_1` through `level_10`) — extract the numeric value.
    - `Kilimani_pressure`: Atmospheric pressure encoded as strings (`kp1` through `kp25`) — extract the numeric value.
    - `Hawassa_pressure`: Contains missing values (sensor outages at the Hawassa weather station) — impute with the column median (we cannot drop test rows).

    The `prepare_data` helper below handles all three. Run this cell before attempting any challenge.

    ## Challenge 1: Variable Selection Using Correlation

    In Module 2 we found that five provincial temperature columns inflate VIF into the thousands because they measure the same underlying national weather pattern. Rather than feeding all 56 features into a regularized model blindly, we'll prune first: keep only the features that have a meaningful linear relationship with the target.

    Features with low correlation to `energy_shortfall_3h` add noise without improving predictions — and they slow down every model evaluation unnecessarily.

    ### Task
    Create a function named `select_features_by_correlation` that:
    - Takes a DataFrame and a correlation threshold as input.
    - Computes the absolute Pearson correlation of every numeric feature with `energy_shortfall_3h`.
    - Prints the number of selected features.

    ## Challenge 2: Data Scaling and Ridge Regression

    The 22 selected features live on very different scales: temperatures in Kelvin (~285–305), wind speed in m/s (0–10), pressure in hPa (~995–1030). When regularization penalizes large coefficients, features on bigger scales get penalized more heavily — not because they matter less, but simply because their units are larger. **StandardScaler** removes this bias by transforming each feature to zero mean and unit variance.

    **Ridge regression** (L2 regularization) then applies a penalty proportional to the *square* of each coefficient, shrinking large and unstable coefficients toward zero without eliminating any feature entirely. This directly addresses the multicollinearity we measured in Module 2.

    **Critical rule:** The scaler must be **fit on training data only**, then applied (not refit) to the test data. Fitting on test data would leak future information into the model.

    ### Task
    Create a function named `fit_ridge_model` that:
    - Takes the training DataFrame, the list of selected features, and a regularization parameter `alpha` (default `1.0`).
    - Splits the data 80-20 with `random_state=42`.
    - Scales features using `StandardScaler` — fit on training, transform both.
    - Fits a `Ridge` model on the scaled training set.
    - Evaluates on the scaled test set.
    - Returns `(r2, rmse, scaler, model)` — the scaler and model are returned for use in Challenges 4 and 5.

    ## Challenge 3: LASSO Regression and Sparsity

    **LASSO regression** (L1 regularization) takes a fundamentally different approach. Rather than *shrinking* coefficients proportionally, LASSO applies a penalty proportional to the *absolute value* of each coefficient — which has the geometric effect of forcing small coefficients all the way to exactly zero. This produces **sparse models**: only the most important features survive.

    LASSO is therefore doing two things simultaneously: regularization *and* automatic feature selection. At high enough `alpha`, it will eliminate features we chose by correlation thresholding, revealing which of our 17 are truly doing the heavy lifting.

    ### Task
    Create a function named `fit_lasso_model` that:
    - Takes the training DataFrame, the list of selected features, and a regularization parameter `alpha` (default `1.0`).

    - Fits a `Lasso` model on the scaled training set.

    ## Challenge 4: Model Persistence with pickle

    We have a trained model that took seconds to fit — but in a production environment, models may take hours or days. More importantly, the Maji Ndogo Department of Energy's grid operators need to run this model at 3-hour intervals, 24 hours a day, without access to training data or a data scientist.

    **Model persistence** solves this. Python's `pickle` module serializes any Python object — including trained scikit-learn models with all their fitted parameters — to a binary file on disk. Loading is instantaneous and produces an object that is byte-for-byte identical to the original.

    ### Task
    Create a function named `save_and_reload_model` that:
    - Takes a fitted model object and a file path as input.
    - Saves the model to disk using `pickle.dump` (binary write mode: `'wb'`).

    ## Challenge 5: Generating Predictions for Submission

    The final step: applying our trained Ridge model to the unseen test set and producing the submission file for the Maji Ndogo Department of Energy's leaderboard.

    **Critical constraint:** The test set must be preprocessed using the **same scaler** that was fit on the training data — never refit it on the test data. Refitting would contaminate the model with information from the test set (data leakage), invalidating your evaluation.

    ### Task
    Create a function named `generate_submission` that:
    - Takes the raw test DataFrame (`df_test_raw`), the list of selected features, the fitted scaler, and the fitted Ridge model.
    - Prepares the test data: encode categorical columns, impute missing values with medians.
    - Scales the test features using the **already fitted** scaler (`.transform()` only — no `.fit_transform()`).
    - Generates predictions using the Ridge model.
    - Returns a DataFrame with columns `time` and `energy_shortfall_3h`.

    Your submission file contains one row per test observation with the predicted energy shortfall in megawatt-hours. The Department's graders will compare these predictions against the actual shortfall values using RMSE. Every unit of improvement on the leaderboard translates directly into a more accurate infrastructure planning tool for the Maji Ndogo Department of Energy.

    ## Wrapping up

    Over three modules you built a complete regression pipeline — from a single predictor with modest explanatory power to a production-ready model deployed via pickle.

    | Module | Technique | RMSE | Key finding |
    |---|---|---|---|
    | **Module 1** (Maji Ndogo) | Simple Linear Regression | baseline | Residuals are normal; framework is sound |
    | **Module 2** (Maji Ndogo Part B) | MLR — 5 provincial temps | ~4,804 | VIF in thousands; multicollinearity is severe |
    | **Module 3** (Maji Ndogo Predict) | Correlation selection + Ridge | ~4,581 | ~4.6% RMSE reduction; model is production-ready |

# Pre-submission readiness check
#
# This cell has NO declared dependencies — it runs even when other cells
# have not. It uses dynamic name lookup (eval + try/except) so the learner
# always gets actionable feedback, including a "run all cells first" hint
# when nothing has been defined yet.
#
# The spec below is auto-generated at conversion time from the test_suite
# (which functions pytest references) and the model solution (the canonical
# parameter names + body characteristics).
