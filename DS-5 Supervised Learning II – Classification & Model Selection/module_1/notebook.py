    Regression tells us *how much*; now it's time to discover *which one*. To shift from numeric forecasting to land and crop classification, you need an architecture designed for categories. In this project, you build your first non-linear model using scikit-learn's `DecisionTreeClassifier` on global population benchmarks. You will trace decision boundaries via tree visualization, evaluate multi-class metrics (precision, recall, and F1-score), and map the bias-variance tradeoff by sweeping `max_depth` to prune away overfit noise. It is the exact interpretability sandbox required to master human-readable logic before deploying algorithms to high-stakes agricultural fields.

    The regression work is done. The Maji Ndogo energy shortfall model is built, validated, and saved. Sanaa has filed the report with the Department of Energy.

    Now she's standing at the whiteboard again, this time with a different question.

    "Regression tells us *how much*," she says. "But I need to know *which one*. Which crop grows best in this field? Is this plot suitable for a new irrigation scheme? Is this soil type too degraded to plant on at all? Those are not numbers — they are categories. And for categories, we need a different kind of model."

    She draws a branching tree structure on the whiteboard. "Decision Trees. They ask a series of yes-or-no questions about the data and funnel each observation toward a prediction. Simple to understand, fast to train, and — critically for our farmers — the decision logic is *human-readable*. We can show a field officer exactly why the model said 'plant cassava here'."

    But before we point a Decision Tree at Maji Ndogo's agricultural data — which is noisy, high-stakes, and feeds directly into planting decisions that affect thousands of farmers — Sanaa wants proof of concept on safer ground.

    > *"Take a dataset where the patterns are well-understood and the stakes are low. Prove the model is working. Then we'll trust it with our fields."*

    She has suggested the **World Population dataset**. Population growth patterns are stable and well-documented. If our Decision Tree can correctly classify countries into population tiers from their historical growth data, we know the algorithm is functioning correctly. This is the trial run before the field test.

    By the end of this notebook you will have:
    - Trained your first `DecisionTreeClassifier` in scikit-learn.
    - Visualized the tree to interpret its decision logic.
    - Evaluated it using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
    - Mapped the bias-variance tradeoff by sweeping `max_depth`.
    - Identified the optimal depth through pruning validation.

    > **AI assist:** Decision tree logic can be abstract. Good prompts: *"Explain the Gini impurity criterion in plain language — what is the model trying to minimize at each split?"* *"What does it mean when a decision tree's training accuracy is 1.0 but test accuracy is 0.6?"*

    ## Challenge 1: Training a Decision Tree Classifier

    We have features and a target. Time to build our first classifier.

    A Decision Tree makes predictions by learning a series of if-else rules from the training data. At each split, it chooses the feature and threshold that best separates the classes — minimizing **Gini impurity** (or entropy). This is the classification analog of minimizing mean squared error in regression trees.

    ### Task
    Create a function named `train_decision_tree` that:
    - Takes a DataFrame, the list of feature columns, the encoded target column name, a `max_depth` parameter (default `3`), and `random_state` (default `42`).
    - Splits the data 80-20 using the given `random_state`.
    - Trains a `DecisionTreeClassifier` with the given `max_depth` on the training set.
    - Returns `(model, X_test, y_test)`.

    **Note:**
    - Use `DecisionTreeClassifier` from `sklearn.tree`.
    - Return format: `(model, X_test, y_test)`.

    ## Challenge 2: Visualizing the Tree

    - Adds a descriptive title.
    - Returns the total number of nodes in the tree (`model.tree_.node_count`).

    ## Challenge 3: Evaluating the Classifier

    A diagram is useful for interpretation, but decisions need numbers. We will use **accuracy** — the proportion of test samples correctly classified — and the **classification report**, which breaks performance down by class with precision, recall, and F1-score.

    - Takes the fitted model, `X_test`, `y_test`, and the `LabelEncoder` object `le`.

    - Prints the full classification report.
    - Returns overall accuracy as a float.

    **Note:**
    - Use `accuracy_score` and `classification_report` from `sklearn.metrics`.
    - Return format: `float` (accuracy only).

    ## Challenge 4: The Effect of Tree Depth — Bias-Variance in Classification

    The bias-variance tradeoff applies to classification just as it does to regression. A shallow tree underfits (high bias — it cannot capture the true patterns). A very deep tree overfits (high variance — it memorizes the training data, including noise, and fails to generalize).

    Plotting training and test accuracy against `max_depth` makes this tradeoff visible: training accuracy rises monotonically, while test accuracy peaks and then plateaus or drops.

    ### Task
    Create a function named `depth_vs_accuracy` that:
    - Takes the DataFrame, feature columns, encoded target column, and a list of depths to test.
    - For each depth, trains a `DecisionTreeClassifier` (80-20 split, `random_state=42`) and records both training and test accuracy.
    - Plots both curves on the same figure with a legend, axis labels, and title.
    - Returns a DataFrame with columns `depth`, `train_accuracy`, and `test_accuracy`.

    Look at the plot. At which depth does test accuracy peak before leveling off or declining? That is roughly the sweet spot where the tree captures real patterns without memorizing noise. Notice that training accuracy eventually reaches 1.0 (perfect) — the tree has enough splits to memorize every training example. The divergence between the two curves is the visual signature of overfitting. In Module 2, we will use ensemble methods to push past this limit without increasing the risk of a single-tree overfit.

    ## Challenge 5: Pruning Validation — Finding the Optimal `max_depth`

    Challenge 4 showed us the tradeoff visually. Now we formalize it: identify the `max_depth` that maximizes test accuracy and train the final benchmark model at that depth.

    ### Task
    Create a function named `find_optimal_depth` that:
    - Takes the results DataFrame from Challenge 4, the modeling DataFrame, feature columns, target column, and `random_state` (default `42`).
    - Identifies the `max_depth` with the highest `test_accuracy`.
    - If multiple depths tie, selects the shallowest (simpler models are preferred when performance is equal).
    - Trains a final `DecisionTreeClassifier` at the optimal depth on an 80-20 split with the given `random_state`.
    - Returns `(optimal_depth, final_model)`.

    ### Expected Output
    ```
    Optimal max_depth: 2
    Number of leaves in final model: 3
    ```

    ## Wrapping up

    The Global Benchmark Trial is complete. The World Population dataset gave us a clean, low-stakes environment to prove that Decision Trees can learn from multi-feature data and make sensible multi-class predictions.

    **Key findings:**

    | Finding | Detail |
    |---|---|
    | Shallow tree (depth 3) | Reasonable accuracy, fully interpretable — every decision can be traced |
    | Deep trees | Training accuracy → 1.0; test accuracy peaks then levels off — classic overfitting signature |
    | Optimal depth | The pruning sweet spot: complex enough to capture real patterns, simple enough to generalize |

    The Maji Ndogo agricultural data is messier and higher-stakes than world population counts. But we have now proven that the decision tree framework is sound. We know how to train it, visualize it, evaluate it, and tune it.

    **What Sanaa asked for:** proof that the model works before we trust it with the fields.

    **What we delivered:** a complete benchmarking workflow — train, visualize, evaluate, sweep depths, prune — that will transfer directly to the crop classification task waiting in Module 2.
